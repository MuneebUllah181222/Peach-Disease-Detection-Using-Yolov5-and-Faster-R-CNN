# Peach-Disease-Detection-Using-Yolov5-and-Faster-R-CNN
Detection of Healthy and Diseased Peaches
Plant diseases have a significant impact on productivity and public health. It is crucial to quickly and accurately detect and identify plant diseases. Detection of such diseases can reduce the cost and time for farmers. Manual detection of plant diseases by experts and farmers' naked eyes is both expensive and time-consuming. Using image data, deep learning has been used to identify diseased and healthy plants. However, collecting image data for peach fruits is challenging because the samples are unbalanced. Popular deep networks struggle with this problem.
The most prevalent diseases in peaches are brown rot, shot hole, scab, and black rot. We have data for three classes in the proposed project: brown rot, shot hole, and healthy peaches. Using cutting-edge deep learning models, we will recognize infected and healthy peaches, as well as the sort of diseased fruit.
To compete, cutting-edge deep learning models, Faster R-CNN and YOLOv5 are tested on the collected data to complete this objective challenge we encountered in the proposed project is the lack of images for brown rot disease. This makes the dataset imbalanced, and in return, it challenges the accuracy of our models during the training and testing phases. Both models performed much better when we gathered more data to balance the dataset for the brown rot peach fruits.
